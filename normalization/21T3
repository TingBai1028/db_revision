A. 
    A -> BC
    D -> EF

B. 
    fds: A -> BC, D -> EF, pk: AD

    A -> BC doesn't satisfy BCNF, since there is no pk in lfs

    Decompose into
        S = ABC, Fs = {A -> BC}, key(S) = A 
        T = ADEF, Ft = {D -> EF}, key(T) = AD 

    D -> EF doesn't satisfy BCNF, since there is not pk in lfs 

    Decompose into 
        U = DEF, Fu = {D -> EF}, key(U) = D 
        V = AD, Fv = {}, key(V) = AD 

    result: 
        S = ABC, key(S) = A 
        U = DEF, key(U) = D 
        V = AD, key(V) = AD 

C. 
    S: student table 
    U: supervisor table 
    V: student to supervisor relationship
